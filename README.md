# Distributed-Systems

This repository contains individual projects (built using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)) for practising distributed systems programming in Java.\
**Note**: If you want a quick tutorial for Maven, please checkout my [maven-tutorial](https://github.com/faizan2786/maven-tutorial) repo.

The repo is created to demonstrate various *Distributed Systems concepts* in action using **Java**. It borrows examples and tutorials from the highly recommended **Udemy course** [Distributed Systems & Cloud Computing with Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/distributed-systems-cloud-computing-with-java/). It uses state-of-the art open source tools and frameworks such as Zookeeper, Kafka, Hadoop etc.that are widely used in the industry. 

## Repo Structure
The repo contains several **modules** (i.e. folders), each for a different distributed system technology.\
Each module contains **multiple** **projects** to demonstrate different distributed system concepts using that tool.

The ***repo-level*** `pom.xml` file includes all the individual modules in the repo and the ***module-level*** `pom.xml` file includes all the individual projects in that module.
