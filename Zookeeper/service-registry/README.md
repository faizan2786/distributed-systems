# Service Registry

A **service registry** is a service (program) used in distributed systems mainly, to manage records of active worker nodes in a cluster. It stores and updates addresses of all available worker nodes in the system. In a **leader-follower** based system, service registry can be used by **leaders** to query list of active worker nodes in the system at any time.
